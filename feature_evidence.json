The five existing survival tips should remain unchanged in content; only the section title/byline attribution must reflect both names. Keep the existing distressed typewriter aesthetic.",

      "featureTitle": "Implement a full-screen code entry gate that blocks access to all site content until the user submits the correct code '2112'. When the site loads, display a full-screen overlay (matching the Backrooms/Dreamcore aesthetic — void black background, fluorescent accent, monospace font) with a prompt such as 'Enter Access Code' and a text input field plus a submit button. If the user submits '2112', dismiss the gate and reveal the site. If they submit an incorrect code, display an in-place error message (e.g., 'ACCESS DENIED') with a subtle flicker animation and keep the gate visible. The gate state should persist for the browser session (sessionStorage) so refreshing the page does not re-show the gate after a successful entry.",
