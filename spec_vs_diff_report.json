  "summary": "The diff implements nearly all requirements for the Backrooms & Dreamcore website rebuild. All major sections (Hero, Lore, Levels, Dreamcore, Survival Guide, Footer, NavBar) are created or updated with appropriate theming, content, and animations. REQ-22 through REQ-24 are well covered. One notable issue: GallerySection.tsx was modified to use knight-themed assets rather than being removed or fully replaced, which may leave references to old assets. Overall coverage is very high with one potential gap regarding old section files.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "Old section component files referencing Dark Fantasy content should have all Dark Fantasy/photo-enhancement references removed. The file-summary for GallerySection.tsx explicitly states it was updated with knight-themed assets (gallery-knight1 through gallery-knight5) preserving enhancement labels, meaning old knight imagery and photo-enhancement references may still exist in that file.",
      "reason": "The diff summary for GallerySection.tsx states 'Gallery section with all five before/after card image pairs replaced with knight-themed assets (gallery-knight1 through gallery-knight5), preserving all enhancement labels and hover interactions.' This suggests the file still references knight imagery and enhancement labels, violating REQ-14 AC: 'Old knight images are no longer referenced' and 'No references to Dark Fantasy by Ricay or photo enhancement remain anywhere on the page.' While GallerySection is not rendered in App.tsx, the file still exists with these references.",
